        <p class="intro-paragraph">
          Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with a cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball validly will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.

          <h3 class="sub-heading">History:</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">
            The history of tennis spans centuries, with origins rooted in ancient civilizations and the evolution of the modern game stemming from medieval Europe. Real tennis, played indoors with unique equipment and rules, gave way to lawn tennis in 19th-century England, spurred by Major Walter Clopton Wingfield's innovation and the standardization of courts and equipment. The sport gained global popularity through events like Wimbledon and the establishment of formal governing bodies like the International Tennis Federation (ITF). The Open Era, inaugurated in 1968, revolutionized tennis by allowing both amateurs and professionals to compete in major tournaments, ushering in increased competition and global recognition. Today, tennis stands as a universal sport played and watched by millions worldwide across amateur and professional levels, with Grand Slam tournaments like the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open serving as pinnacle events in the tennis calendar.

          <h3 class="sub-heading">Rules of the game:</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">
            The rules of tennis are relatively straightforward and are designed to ensure fair play and competitive matches. Here's a summary of the basic rules:
            <ul class="list-container">
              <li class="list">
                <h4>Scoring:</h4>
                <p>
                  Tennis matches are typically played in sets, with each set consisting of games, and each game comprising points. To win a game, a player must score four points and have a two-point advantage over their opponent. The points are counted as follows: 15, 30, 40, and then game point. If both players reach 40 (known as a deuce), one player must win two consecutive points to win the game.
  
                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="list">
                <h4>Serving:</h4>
                <p>
                  The player who serves alternates between points and games. The server must stand behind the baseline and hit the ball into the diagonally opposite service box on the other side of the net. The server gets two chances (first and second serve) to start each point. If the serve hits the net and lands in the correct service box, it's called a lot, and the server gets to serve again without penalty.

                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="list">
                <h4>Court Dimensions:</h4>
                <p>
                  The tennis court is divided into two halves by a net. Each half is further divided into service boxes and a larger area called the court. The lines on the court are considered in play.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="list">
                <h4>Scoring Sets:</h4>
                <p>
                  A set is won by the player who is the first to win at least six games and has a two-game lead over their opponent. If the set reaches a tie at 6-6, a tiebreaker is usually played to determine the winner of the set. In a tiebreaker, the first player to reach at least seven points with a two-point advantage wins the tiebreaker and the set. 
                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="list">
                <h4>Winning the Match:</h4>
                <p>Matches are typically played as the best of three sets for women and the best of five sets for men in most professional tournaments. To win the match, a player must win the specified number of sets before their opponent.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="list">
                <h4>Other Rules:</h4>
                <p>
                  There are various other rules governing aspects such as let serves, foot faults, out-of-bounds shots, and interference during play. Players are expected to adhere to the code of conduct and sportsmanship principles during matches.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="paragraph">
              These are the fundamental rules of tennis, though there are more nuanced regulations that govern professional matches and tournaments, including rules regarding coaching, time violations, and medical timeouts.

          <h3 class="sub-heading">Strategy of the game:</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Tennis is a game of strategy as much as it is a test of physical skill. Here are some key strategic elements players often employ during a match:
            <ul class="list-container">
              <li class="list">
                <h4>Serve and Return: </h4>
                <p>The serve is a player's first opportunity to gain an advantage in a point. Players often strategize about placement, speed, and spin to set up their next shot. On the other hand, returning players aim to neutralize the serve and gain control of the point.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="list">
                <h4>Shot Selection:</h4>
                <p>Players must decide whether to hit the ball with power, spin, or placement, depending on their position on the court and their opponent's weaknesses. They may also use drop shots, lobs, and slices to keep their opponents off balance.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="list">
                <h4>Court Positioning:</h4>
                <p>Players strategically position themselves on the court to anticipate their opponent's shots and cover the most likely areas the ball will be returned to. They may aim to take control of the center of the court or move closer to the net to put pressure on their opponent.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="list">
                <h4>Playing to Strengths:</h4>
                <p>Players often play to their strengths by hitting shots that capitalize on their best skills. For example, a player with a strong forehand may look to dictate play with aggressive shots to that side of the court.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="list">
                <h4>Adapting to Opponent:</h4>
                <p>Successful players can adapt their strategy based on their opponent's playing style and weaknesses. They may change the pace, spin, or placement of their shots to exploit vulnerabilities or disrupt their opponent's rhythm.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="list">
                <h4>Mental Toughness:</h4>
                <p>Tennis matches can be mentally demanding, and maintaining focus and composure is essential. Players must stay mentally tough during difficult situations, such as facing break points or serving to stay in the match.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="list">
                <h4>Fitness and Endurance:</h4>
                <p>Tennis matches can be physically demanding, especially in long rallies and extended matches. Players must maintain their fitness and endurance to perform at their best throughout the match.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Overall, a successful tennis strategy involves a combination of skill, anticipation, adaptability, and mental toughness. Players who can effectively execute their game plan while adjusting to the flow of the match are often the most successful on the court.
