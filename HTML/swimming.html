          Swimming is a racing sport that can be played in solo and team sports. To go through the water, one must use
          their full body. The sport is performed in open water, such as lakes and oceans, or in pools. One of the most
          popular Olympic sports is competitive swimming, which comprises a variety of distance events in the butterfly,
          backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and individual medley. There's also the potential of four-swimmer
          freestyle or medley relays in addition to these individual events. Four swimmers who alternate between the
          backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, and freestyle strokes make up a medley relay.

        <h3 class="sub-heading">History:</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          There is proof that people swam for amusement in prehistoric periods; the earliest examples are drawings from
          the Stone Age, which date back about 10,000 years. Records in writing date back to 2000 BC. Some of the
          earliest references to swimming can be found in the Bible, the Iliad, the Odyssey, Beowulf, the Quran, and
          other ancient writings. The German-Swiss professor of languages Nikolaus Wynmann wrote the first comprehensive
          treatise about swimming in 1538. Colymbetes, sive de arte Natandi conversation et festivus et fundus lecture
          is the title of the book, which is subtitled Joyful and Pleasant to Read or The Swimmer, or A Conversation on
          the Art of Swimming.
          <br>
          In the 1830s, swimming gained popularity in England as a competitive recreational sport. In 1828, St George's
          Baths opened as the world's first indoor swimming pool. By 1837, the National Swimming Society was holding
          regular swimming competitions and six artificial swimming pools had been built throughout London.
          As the pastime gained popularity, more than 300 regional clubs were operating nationwide by the time the
          Amateur Swimming Association, the nation's first national governing body, was established in 1880.

        <h3 class="sub-heading">Rules of the game:</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Around the world, swimming is a popular sport and leisure activity for people of all ages. To ensure safety
          and equity, a variety of rules and criteria apply to swimming contests and practices. The following are some
          basic swimming guidelines:
        <ul class="list-container">
          <li class="list">
            <h4>Stroke rules:</h4>
            <p>
              Freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly are among the strokes used in competitive swimming.
              There are particular guidelines for arm movements, leg kicks, breathing patterns, and techniques for each
              stroke.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="list">
            <h4>Starts and Turns:</h4>
            <p>
              Competitor swimming depends heavily on proper starts and turns. To avoid being disqualified, swimmers must
              follow certain rules make legal turns, and start from the starting blocks during competitions.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="list">
            <h4>Pool length:</h4>
            <p>
              Events involving competitive swimming usually happen in pools that are either 25 meters or 50 meters long.
              Depending on the event, the proper pool length must be used for every competition.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="list">
            <h4>Lane Etiquette:</h4>
            <p>
              Lane etiquette is something that swimmers need to follow in both training and competition. This entails
              remaining in their designated lanes, letting go of swimmers who move more quickly, and refraining from
              interfering with other swimmers.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="list">
            <h4>Equipment Regulations:</h4>
            <p>
              Generally speaking, swimmers are permitted to wear swimsuits, goggles, and swim caps while competing. But
              there are rules about what kinds of swimsuits are acceptable for competition swimming, including
              requirements for coverage, fabric, and design.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="list">
            <h4>Disqualification:</h4>
            <p>
              A swimmer may be disqualified from competition for several offenses, such as illegal turns, incorrect
              strokes, false starts, and interfering with other swimmers. Officials from the race choose who is
              disqualified, and it can mean that the swimmer's time is void.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="list">
            <h4>Doping regulations:</h4>
            <p>
              Doping Guidelines Strict anti-doping rules are in place for swimming, just like they are for other sports,
              to stop the use of performance-enhancing drugs. To ensure fair competition, swimmers are tested for drugs
              both nationally and internationally.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="list">
            <h4>Safety precautions:</h4>
            <p>
              Swimming safety is very important, especially for younger or less experienced swimmers. To guarantee a
              safe swimming environment and prevent accidents, pool rules must be followed, lifeguards must be on duty,
              and supervision must be provided.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Depending on the particular type of swimming event and the regulatory organization in charge of the
          competition, these rules may change slightly. Officials, coaches, and swimmers must all be aware of the rules
          and guidelines that apply to their particular level of competition and adhere to them.

        <h3 class="sub-heading">Players of the game:</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Generally speaking, swimming is an individual sport, meaning that participation doesn't depend on the number
          of players. Individual practice of strokes, endurance, and technique can be undertaken by swimmers. But
          swimming can also entail team events, such as relays, in which a group of swimmers competes as a unit.
          <br>
          Teams competing in relay events typically have four swimmers who, depending on the type of relay, swim a
          predetermined distance, such as 200 or 100 meters. In a relay race, four swimmers are needed in total.
          <br>
          Swimming does not have a minimum or maximum number of participants for specific races or practices. No set
          minimum or maximum number of participants is required for swimming laps, timed trials, or different training
          drills.
          <br>
          Here are some popular players:
        <ul class="list-container">

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-container">
        <h3 class="sub-heading">Strategy of the game:</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Strategic considerations in swimming vary greatly based on the type of race and individual strengths. Sprint races emphasize sheer speed and power, necessitating explosive launches, quick turnover rates, and precise corners. Shorter course swimmers, such as those competing in the 50- or 100-meter freestyle, frequently concentrate on sustaining maximum speed throughout, using effective stroke mechanics, and utilizing powerful underwater kicks and smooth turns. 
          <br>
          On the other hand, longer races, like the 400- or 800-meter freestyle, need a careful balancing act between endurance and pace. Early in the race, swimmers intentionally preserve energy, progressively picking up speed to ensure they have adequate reserves for a great finish. Mental readiness is critical at all lengths, and the ability to visualize, concentrate, and maintain confidence are critical components of successful race strategy execution.
          <br>
          The key to a successful swimming strategy is adaptability. Swimmers need to be aware of the conditions of the race, modifying their strategy according to elements like lane positioning, competitive dynamics, and weather and water temperature. In longer races, tactical maneuvers like leaping ahead or drafting behind rivals can be quite advantageous. A swimmer's strategy also heavily considers nutrition, hydration, and recovery; maintaining top performance requires appropriate pre-race increasing and post-race recovery regimes. Ultimately, to traverse the complexity of competition and achieve optimal performance in the water, swimming strategy combines physical conditioning, technical proficiency, mental toughness, and situational awareness.
