          Athletics, a sport as ancient as human civilization itself, encompasses a vast array of disciplines showcasing
          the pinnacle of physical prowess, speed, agility, strength, and endurance.
          <br>
          From the thundering footsteps of sprinters exploding out of the blocks to the graceful arcs of high jumpers
          soaring over the bar, athletics captivates audiences worldwide with its raw power and finesse. Track and field
          events, the core of athletics, include sprints, hurdles, middle and long-distance races, relays, jumps (such
          as long jump, high jump, and triple jump), throws (like shot put, discus, javelin, and hammer throw), and
          combined events like the decathlon and heptathlon.
          <br>
          Each event demands a unique blend of technique, athleticism, and mental fortitude, pushing athletes to their
          limits in pursuit of personal and collective glory. Whether on the world stage of the Olympics, the hallowed
          grounds of historic stadiums, or the humble tracks of local communities, athletics serves as a testament to
          human potential and the enduring spirit of competition, inspiring generations to strive for greatness and
          surpass the boundaries of what was once thought possible.

        <h3 class="sub-heading">History:</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The history of athletics is deeply intertwined with the evolution of human civilization. Dating back to
          ancient times, athletics played a central role in various cultures, serving as a means of physical training,
          religious expression, and social cohesion. In ancient Greece, athletic competitions were an integral part of
          religious festivals, notably the Olympic Games, first held in Olympia in 776 BCE.
          <br>
          These early contests featured events like running, wrestling, boxing, and chariot racing, drawing athletes
          from across the Greek world to compete for honor and prestige. The Romans later adopted and expanded upon
          these traditions, organizing grand spectacles in colossal arenas such as the Circus Maximus.
          <br>
          With the decline of the Roman Empire, athletics faded from prominence in Europe but persisted in other
          regions. In medieval England, for example, folk games like football and mob football provided outlets for
          physical activity and community bonding.
          <br>
          The Renaissance witnessed a revival of interest in classical ideals, sparking a renewed enthusiasm for
          athletics across Europe. The modern era of athletics began to take shape in the 19th century with the
          establishment of formalized rules and competitions. The formation of athletic clubs and organizations, such as
          the Amateur Athletic Club (AAC) in England and the New York Athletic Club (NYAC) in the United States, laid
          the groundwork for the codification and standardization of various sports.
          <br>
          The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw the rise of international sporting events, including the revival of
          the Olympic Games in 1896 under the leadership of Baron Pierre de Coubertin. This marked the beginning of
          modern athletics on a global scale, with athletes from diverse nations coming together to compete in a spirit
          of friendship and sportsmanship.
          <br>
          Since then, athletics has continued to evolve, with advancements in training methods, technology, and sports
          science pushing the boundaries of human performance. Today, athletics remains one of the most popular and
          revered sports worldwide, with a rich history that continues to inspire athletes and enthusiasts alike.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph-container">
        <h3 class="sub-heading">Rules of the game:</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The rules of athletics vary depending on the specific event, but there are some general principles and
          regulations that apply across most disciplines. These rules are established by international governing bodies
          such as World Athletics (formerly known as the International Association of Athletics Federations, or IAAF)
          and are implemented at all levels of competition, from local meets to the Olympic Games.
          <br>
          Common rules in athletics include guidelines for equipment, such as specifications for track surfaces, field
          dimensions, and implements used in throwing events like shot put or javelin. Athletes are also required to
          adhere to rules regarding their attire, including uniform regulations and restrictions on
          performance-enhancing equipment.
          <br>
          In terms of competition rules, events are typically governed by specific regulations regarding starting
          procedures, race tactics, fouls, and disqualifications. For example, in sprinting events, false starts are
          penalized with disqualification, while in distance running, athletes must stay within their assigned lanes for
          a certain distance after the start of the race. In field events like the long jump or high jump, athletes must
          adhere to strict take-off points and landing zones to ensure fair competition.
          <br>
          Additionally, rules regarding doping and anti-doping measures are crucial in athletics to maintain the
          integrity of the sport and protect the health and safety of athletes. Drug testing procedures are conducted
          regularly, and athletes found to have violated anti-doping regulations face sanctions ranging from suspensions
          to lifetime bans from competition.
          <br>
          Overall, adherence to these rules ensures fair play, safety, and the preservation of the spirit of athletics
          as a test of natural talent, skill, and determination.

        <h3 class="sub-heading">Popular players:</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The number of players required to participate in athletics events varies depending on the specific discipline.
          Some events, such as sprinting, hurdling, and jumping, are individual sports where only one athlete competes
          at a time. In contrast, relay races involve teams of four athletes passing a baton around a track. Field
          events like shot put, discus throw, and javelin throw typically involve one athlete competing at a time, but
          multiple athletes may compete simultaneously in the same event.
          <br>
          In team sports like basketball or soccer, the number of players required is fixed, with specific rules
          governing team size and substitutions. However, in athletics, the number of participants can vary widely
          depending on the event, ranging from solo performances to team relays.
          <br>
          Here are some popular players:
          <br>

              until the final stretch.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="list">
            <h4>Hurdles:</h4>
            <p>Hurdling involves maintaining speed while clearing obstacles. Athletes strategize by finding a rhythm

              their momentum.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="list">
            <h4>Jumps:</h4>
            <p>Jumpers aim to achieve maximum distance or height while adhering to specific take-off points or bar
              heights. The strategy involves mastering technique, generating optimal speed and power during the

          </li>
          <li class="list">
            <h4>Throws:</h4>
            <p>Throwers focus on generating maximum force and achieving optimal angles to propel implements like shot
              puts discuses, or javelins. The strategy involves mastering throwing techniques, utilizing momentum from
              the rotational or linear motion, and adjusting for factors like wind and weather conditions.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="list">
            <h4>Relays:</h4>
            <p>Relay teams strategize on baton exchanges, typically aiming for seamless transitions to maintain momentum
              and minimize time lost during handoffs. Athletes also plan race tactics, such as positioning their fastest
              runners on specific legs or conserving energy for the final stretch.
            </p>
          </li>
